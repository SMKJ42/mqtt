## About

The point of this crate is to give quick familiarity with the API. It is not intended to restrict you to a certain path way to handle a connection. Check out the source code for this crate, it is very lightweight and heavily relies on the `mqtt-core` crate for functionality. If you need a different way to access the TCP stream, check out the `mqtt-core::v3` module to access the packet codec library directly.
